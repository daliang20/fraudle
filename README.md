# Fraudle

Are your friends all playing Wordle and sending you their annoying emoji
squares all the time? Wish you could participate, but you can't be bothered to
actually play Wordle for the 15th time?

Now your troubles are over.

Simply choose your desired skill level and Fraudle will generate an annoying
emoji square that you can copy and paste anywhere you like to share your
meaningless "accomplishment" with the world.
